# Let's Learn a Bit

## Abstract

Bits are the fundamental building blocks in which all computing is built on. And yet the mere mention of shifting them around is enough to get the average developer's head spinning. Bitwise operations don't need to be scary. They can be fun! In this talk we'll expore bitwise operations, including shifting, and gain a solid understanding of how they function. Then, to play with our new skills, we'll use bit shifting and other operations to store and retrieve a hidden message in an image (steganography).
