# Let's Learn a Bit

## Abstract

Bitwise operations, while seldom used, can be extremely powerful. Yet the average developer fears and avoid them. The purpose of this talk is to demystify bitwise operations, especially shifting, and then apply them to a fun example, steganography, hiding messages in images.

## Description

Bits are the fundamental building blocks on which all computing is built. And yet the mere mention of shifting them around is enough to send the average developer's head spinning. Bitwise operations don't need to be scary. They can be fun! In this talk we'll explore common bitwise operations, including shifting, and gain a solid understanding of how they function. Then, to play with our new skills, we'll use bit shifting and other operations to store and retrieve a hidden messages in images (including a brief introduction to steganography).
