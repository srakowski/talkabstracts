# Game Jams: Not Just For Game Developers

## Abstract

Do you want to be a better developer? Have you ever wanted to create a video game? Do you like a challenge? Then you should participate in a game jam!

I am not a game developer. I write enterprise software like most other developers out there. But a few times a year I lock myself away for a weekend to create video games. In doing so I've come to the belief that professional developers like me have a lot to gain from doing the same. In this talk we'll discuss what game jams are and how they can help you to become a better developer. Along the way I'll share some of my personal experiences and what I learned from them.
